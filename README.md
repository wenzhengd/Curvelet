## üß† Background & Motivation

In quantum systems, **dephasing decoherence** remains a fundamental challenge that undermines qubit coherence over time. Traditional solutions like **dynamical decoupling** rely on fast, discrete control pulses, while **numerical optimal control** techniques often sacrifice physical interpretability for performance.

This project proposes a novel alternative: a **geometrically guided, wavelet-augmented framework** for designing control protocols. We aim to explore realistic, **smooth control curves** (dubbed **tantrices**) using **wavelet-based signal analysis**‚Äîan approach that is both physically meaningful and analytically tractable.

## üîÅ Curvelet Framework: Geometry Meets Wavelets

At the heart of this method lies the **Curvelet**, a unification of:

- **Tantrix** ‚Äì A smooth geometric curve representing a physically realizable control path.
- **Wavelets** ‚Äì Analytic-numerical basis functions that allow localized, multi-scale control refinement.

This hybrid offers both **interpretability** and **robustness**, allowing the control path to evolve through a self-correcting feedback loop guided by coherence criteria.

## üîß Iterative Control Optimization Pipeline

The control optimization proceeds as an iterative feedback loop between the **real tantrix space** and a **wavelet-based control manifold** \( \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{F} \). Here's a step-by-step view, as illustrated in the figure:

1. **Start with a real tantrix** \( r(t)^{(i)} \):  
   An initial control ansatz, constrained to be smooth and realistic.

2. **Wavelet Expansion**:  
   This control is expanded in the wavelet basis, mapping it onto the current manifold \( \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{F}^{(i)} \). This process reveals how well it resists decoherence by checking for **coherence leakage**.

3. **Leakage Check & Manifold Surgery** ü§ñ:  
   If significant decoherence is detected, a feedback mechanism:
   - Identifies leakage pathways.
   - Expands the manifold to \( \mathcal{M}_\mathcal{F}^{(i+1)} \), accommodating more expressive wavelet functions to better approximate the ideal control.

4. **Map & Normalize to Pseudo-Tantrix** \( \tilde{r}(t)^{(i)} \):  
   The improved wavelet solution is mapped back to a physically meaningful tantrix, through a pseudo tantrix transitionally , preserving smoothness.

5. **Re-injection for Iteration**:  
   The new tantrix is fed back for another cycle of wavelet projection and refinement.

üîÅ **This iterative loop continues until the decoherence is sufficiently suppressed.**  
üß† **Convergence is not required**; useful, robust control paths can emerge in finite iterations.
